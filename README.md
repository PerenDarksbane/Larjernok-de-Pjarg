# Dictionary
A dictionary... for my own language... (defined in Library.properties)

If you guys want to add vocabulary, email plankp@outlook.com (me) the word and I will respond ASAP.

## Rules
* "C" is prononced as "Ch" in "Cheese" and "CC" is pronounced as "K"
* Verbs do not have tenses not conjugation. They are always infinitive and time is what matters
* Articles of the start of the phrase must be omitted
* "The" does not exist because it is always omitted
* During speech, "He" is always used (not "She" or "It"). Not during writing however
* "Pjok" is pronounced like "Peeyok"
